      <h2>
        A pair of young filmmakers revolutionized horror in 1999. Maryland was
        their backdrop.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Burkittsville, a village of less than 200 in Western Maryland, became
        the subject of national attention in 1999. A rumor had percolated that
        three filmmakers were last seen there before inexplicably disappearing
        into a nearby forest while they investigated the legend of the “Blair
        Witch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A Netscape-era website that saw millions of visitors per day teased that
        a production company was making a documentary using footage discovered
        in the forest where they disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        That “documentary,” titled “The Blair Witch Project,” was so wildly
        successful that it birthed a new horror subgenre. With that, the
        Maryland-coded imagery of a sleepy village, the woods and the mysticism
        of a fabled witch became iconic symbols of the found-footage subgenre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Found-footage horror films exploded in popularity afterward, according
        to a Banner analysis of over 4,000 horror movies. While
        documentary-style horror existed before, “The Blair Witch Project” led
        to the labeling of “found footage” films.

        “Something that we had written had been made into a whole subgenre of
        film,” said Eduardo Sánchez, who directed, wrote and edited “The Blair
        Witch Project” with Daniel Myrick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The movie had a budget of $60,000 and was created by Sánchez and Myrick
        when they were in their late 20s. Today’s blockbuster horror movies
        often cost tens of millions of dollars to make.
      </p>

      <p>
        That low budget meant the film had no professional lighting, no costumes
        and no soundtrack. It instead tells its story through the amateur lens
        of three young filmmakers who are figuring the film out as they go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sánchez was practically living that life. He, too, was young and hungry
        for success in the filmmaking business. “The Blair Witch Project” was
        his last attempt at that before he would be forced to pivot careers, he
        said, and he had no idea if something so experimental would work.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The story of the filmmakers was very much our story, and how we were
        making the movie was very much the way that they were making their
        movie,” Sánchez said. “It was very immersive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The shaky footage, naivete and unpredictability that fed off of
        Sánchez’s own experiences made “The Blair Witch Project” feel
        unsettlingly real and would define the found-footage subgenre.
      </p>

      <p>
        It grossed $250 million worldwide, making it one of the most profitable
        independent films of all time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of the 60 horror movies set in Maryland, 10 are found-footage films, a
        trend started by “The Blair Witch Project.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s the third highest number of found-footage films set in any state,
        trailing only California and New York, where thousands of horror movies
        are set.

        Found footage seems like a surefire way to success for these filmmakers.
        Of the 10 found-footage films set in Maryland, seven have among the
        highest IMDb rankings of horror movies set in Maryland.

        “The Blair Witch Project” also revived two other subgenres: backwoods
        horror and isolation horror.

        The film largely unfolds in the fictional Black Hills Forest, which is
        actually vast leafy Seneca Creek State Park in Gaithersburg, near where
        Sánchez grew up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s great during the day, and then as the sun goes down, everybody
        goes to sleep, you start hearing things,” Sánchez said. “Your
        imagination goes crazy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The entity terrorizing the protagonists is an apparent witch that has
        haunted the forest since the late 1700s, when she was persecuted. The
        plot feels distinct to Maryland’s colonial legacy of women being
        persecuted for “witchcraft.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It feels like the movie could have been in many different places, but
        it seems now, looking back like this, Maryland was the perfect place for
        it,” Sánchez said.

          The Banner used OpenAI’s large language model GPT 4.1 to classify key
          characteristics of over 4,000 horror films, such as subgenre, setting
          and characteristics of the protagonist. The Banner chose GPT 4.1 after
          testing it against other OpenAI, Anthropic and Google models and
          verifying that results from GPT 4.1 were 100% accurate during testing.

          This process was conducted on an initial database that contained the
          title of the horror movie, the year of its release, its IMDb
          description and the state that it was set in. That database was
          sourced from a Reddit user who compiled a list of horror movies using
          classifications from IMDb and Letterboxd to determine if the movie
          belonged in the horror genre. They then studied the movie to determine
          where it was set, using explicit clues, such as direct quotes, and
          subtler clues, such as license plates.
