        But the ‘small but mighty’ school district was one of the worst for
        improving math
      </h2>
      <p>
        In Somerset County, students are bettering their reading skills while
        struggling to make similar strides in math.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a small slice of the state’s big picture, where math proficiency
        rates lag far behind literacy but are still improving bit by bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week, the state released scores for the annual exam given to
        students in grades 3–8 and some high school classes known as the
        Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program, or MCAP. While nearly every
        single grade made improvements in both literacy and math statewide,
        English Language Arts scores continue to far outstrip math performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        With fewer than 3,000 students, Somerset County is the second-smallest
        district in the state. The district bills itself as “small but mighty,”
        and this year emerged as the second-most-improved district for English
        scores.
      </p>

      <p>
        Somerset recently drew outsized attention as parents and teachers fought
        a MAGA-aligned takeover of its school system. Rep. Andy Harris
        threatened to get the Trump administration to withhold federal education
        funds from Maryland unless the state butted out of the board’s attempt
        to remove Somerset County Superintendent Ava Tasker-Mitchell.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at an Aug. 19 board meeting, Tasker-Mitchell — who did not respond
        to an interview request — sat beside the board members who have sought
        her dismissal and praised students and staff for movement in the latest
        round of scores. Although Somerset posted some of the lowest proficiency
        rates in Maryland, the county outpaced the state’s English improvement
        numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We still have a lot of work to do,” Tasker-Mitchell said. “But we have
        to still celebrate the small wins.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are five takeaways from a Banner analysis of Somerset’s school test
        data.
      </p>
      <h2>Doubling the state’s reading improvements</h2>
      <p>
        Somerset County was the state’s second-most-improved district in
        English, coming in behind Dorchester County, a slightly larger system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Smaller school districts are prone to wider test score swings from one
        year to the next. With smaller student bodies, a one- or two-percentage
        point change can be driven by just a handful of students’ results.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this year’s scores, four of the seven biggest year-to-year shifts in
        either English or math pass rates happened in districts with around
        7,000 students or fewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somerset County students made a 4.7 percentage point jump in their
        overall reading score, nearly double the 2.4 percentage point
        improvement across all of Maryland.
      </p>
      <p>
        The district’s English proficiency rate was the second-lowest in
        Maryland, at 35.1%, ahead of just Baltimore City. The state posted a
        50.8% proficiency rate.
      </p>
      <h2>Barely any movement for math</h2>
      <p>
        Somerset County has the state’s lowest math passing rate, at 10.1%. It
        also posted the second-smallest gain in the subject, at just 0.3
        percentage point growth, behind only Calvert County with 0.2 percentage
        points.
      </p>

      <p>
        The state improved by 2.4 percentage points, though Maryland students
        overall really struggle with their numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sixth graders had the strongest math improvement in Somerset, at 5.3
        percentage points to reach 10.6% proficiency. They were the
        third-most-improved in the state compared to other sixth graders.
      </p>
      <h2>Third graders shine</h2>
      <p>
        Somerset’s third graders made the 5th-largest English gains of any grade
        level in the state, with 10.6 percentage point growth to 41.7%
        proficient. The county’s tenth graders were the only grade level to
        score a higher proficiency rate, at 47.6%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third graders also held the county’s highest math proficiency score, at
        25.1%. That’s 15 points ahead of the next-highest-scoring grade level in
        the district.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sixth graders also hit double-digit English gains, at 10 points, and
        tenth graders nearly did, with a 9.9 percentage point increase.
      </p>

      <h2>One of few to lose ground</h2>
      <p>
        Somerset County was one of five districts to post declines in its
        elementary level math scores.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Somerset’s third graders led the district’s math pack, overall,
        the county’s elementary level test takers declined by 0.8 percentage
        points with 15.2% ranked as proficient. They were also the
        lowest-performing elementary students in the state on the math test.
      </p>
      <h2>Big moves for high schools</h2>
      <p>
        The county’s only two high schools with MCAP results, Crisfield High
        School & Academy and Washington High School & Academy, posted large
        increases in their high school English scores: 11.5 percentage points
        and 8.1 percentage points, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Crisfield, their high school proficiency stands at 57.4%, nearly the
        state average for high schoolers, and Washington Academy scored 40.9%.
      </p>
      <iframe

        height="480"
        data-external="1"
      ></iframe>
      <p>
        Both schools have increased their English pass rates by double digits
        since 2022. In the case of Crisfield, the rate increased by more than 20
        points.
